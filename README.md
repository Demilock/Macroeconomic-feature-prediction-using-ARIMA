Macroeconomic feature prediction using ARIMA model
Various macroeconomic and financial features of USA companies
and stocks were predicted using google's latest ARIMA model
which uses auto-regression and moving average to predict
regression values.
The performance was also compared with an LSTM model and Random Forest Regressor(see stock prediction.ipynb).
